# In-browser X-Frame-Options & CORS test

HTML, Javascript, CSS based, environmentless site (no webserver needed, it1s just a html file. Open with your browser.)

> Note that this script does a real check in your browser. That means, it may work differently in another browser - especially in older ones.

Check:
 - **Cross origin** (Can I read the site? If yes, you are also able to read any sensitive data from the user's account)
 - **X-Frame-Options** (can I load site to an iframe - if yes, vulnerable to clockjacking)
